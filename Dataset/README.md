## Motivation
### A strong positive relationship between the sender’s rate and the receiver’s rate (or quality)
link is the delay setup and measured throughput (sending rate at user1) and goodput (receiving rate at user2). <br />
It was used for plotting Figure 1: The CDF of throughput and video quality for applications using cloud servers under delay variation.

### Performance comparison under various network scenarios 
link is the packet loss rate setup and measured throughput and latency of applications. <br />
link is the delay setup and measured throughput and latency of applications. <br />
link is the available bandwidth setup and measured throughput and latency of applications. <br />
They were used for plotting Figure 3: Performance comparison between six video conferencing applications and WebRTC.

Dataset will be posted here soon.
