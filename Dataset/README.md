## Motivation
### A strong positive relationship between the sender’s rate and the receiver’s rate (or quality)
link is delay setup and measured throughput (sending rate at user1) and goodput (receiving rate at user2).
It was used for plotting Figure 1: The CDF of throughput and video quality for applications using cloud servers under delay variation.

Dataset will be posted here soon.
