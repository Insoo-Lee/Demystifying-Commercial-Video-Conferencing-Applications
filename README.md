# Demystifying Commercial Video Conferencing Applications<br/>[ACM Multimedia 2021]

We provide the dataset and tools used in the paper, "Demystifying Commercial Video Conferencing Applications", for reproducibility.

### Estimation of Key Metrics

We estimate the following metrics for our measurement and model inference while running video conferencing applications.
- Sending rate
- Frame rate
- Resolution
- Streaming delay

We introduce the measurement tools in [Tools](https://github.com/Insoo-Lee/Demystifying-Commercial-Video-Conferencing-Applications/tree/main/Tools). 

### Measurement Dataset

We provide the dataset (including the raw data) of the figures in the paper, as well as all experimental results not included in the paper due to the space limitation [here](https://github.com/Insoo-Lee/Demystifying-Commercial-Video-Conferencing-Applications/tree/main/Dataset).
