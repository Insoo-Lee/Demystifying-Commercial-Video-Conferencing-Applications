# Demystifying Commercial Video Conferencing Applications<br/>[ACM Multimedia 2021]

We provide the dataset and tools used in the paper, "Demystifying Commercial Video Conferencing Applications", for reproducibility.

### Estimation of Key Metrics

We estimate the following metrics for our measurement and model inference while running video conferencing applications.
- Sending rate
- Frame rate
- Resolution
- Streaming delay

We introduce the measurement tools in [Tools](https://github.com/Insoo-Lee/Demystifying-Commercial-Video-Conferencing-Applications/Tools/README.md).
